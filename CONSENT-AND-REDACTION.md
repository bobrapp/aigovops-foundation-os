# Consent and Redaction Policy

> Version 0.1 | AiGovOps Foundation

## Principle

Contribution to AiGovOps must never feel extractive. We capture human wisdom with dignity, consent, and the right to be forgotten.

## Contribution Modes

| Mode | What is Captured | What is Published |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Full Record** | Audio/video + transcript + metadata | Summary + decision + attribution |
| **Summary Only** | Transcript processed by agent | Summary + decision only (no raw transcript stored) |
| **Anonymous** | Content only, no identity | Decision content with pseudonym |
| **Off the Record** | Nothing | Nothing |

## Default Behavior

- Default mode is **Summary Only** unless contributor opts into Full Record
- Raw recordings are NEVER published without explicit written consent
- Agent-generated summaries are always reviewed by the contributor before publication

## Consent Process

1. Before any recorded session, participants are informed of the recording mode
2. Each participant selects their consent level (Full/Summary/Anonymous/Off)
3. Consent is recorded as metadata on the resulting GDR
4. Consent can be changed retroactively (see Retraction)

## Pseudonymity

- Contributors may use pseudonyms for any contribution
- The foundation maintains a confidential mapping (accessible only to the Executive Director)
- Pseudonymous contributions carry equal weight in deliberations

## Right to Retract

- Any contributor may request retraction of their testimony at any time
- Retraction process: Submit request to privacy@aigovops.foundation
- Timeline: Content removed within 7 business days
- If the retracted content was the basis for a GDR decision, the GDR is flagged for re-deliberation

## Agent Processing Rules

- Safety/Redaction Agent runs on all transcripts before any publication
- PII is automatically detected and redacted from published summaries
- Contributors are notified of what will be published before it goes live
- Agent logs are retained for audit but access-controlled

## Data Retention

- Published GDR summaries: Retained indefinitely (they are institutional memory)
- Raw transcripts (Full Record mode): Retained for 1 year, then deleted unless renewed
- Agent processing logs: Retained for 2 years for audit, then deleted
- Consent records: Retained as long as any associated content exists
